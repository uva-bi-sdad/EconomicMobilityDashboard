<b>Constructing Cultural Diversity Measures</b>
<p style="text-align:left;">
The cultural diversity domains were informed by stakeholders meetings, workshops, available data sources, and existing literature on the capital. 
The cultural domains, religion and ancestry, are summarized using the following two measures.
<p style="text-align:left;">
1. <u>Richness</u>: The richness measure is the number of groups within the domain, in this case the number of religious groups or the number of different ancestries. 
<p style="text-align:left;">
2. <u>Diversity</u>: Diversity is a function of the number of groups and group members. The index will approach zero when the group members are concentrated in a few groups and will approach one when the group members are evenly distributed. The Gini-Simpson Diversity Index is calculated as:
<p style="text-align:left;">

<p style="text-align:left;">
where R is the richness (number of groups) and p is the relative frequency, the number of group members divided by the total number of members.

<b>Interpreting Domain Measures</b>
<p style="text-align:left;">
Choropleths display the value of the measures at the county level for the selected state. The boxplots below the choropleth display the county and city measures for each state. The filled circles over the box plot indicate the relative rurality of the county or city; the more saturated the shade of orange, the more rural, and the more saturated the shade of olive, the more urban a county or city is.
<p style="text-align:left;">
<b>Index of Relative Rurality</b>
<p style="text-align:left;">
We display variable boxplots by county relative rurality. We assign county rurality using Waldorf and Kim's 2010 Index of Relative Rurality (IRR). The IRR is based on population size, density, remoteness, and built-up area, and ranges from 0 (most urban) to 1 (most rural).
