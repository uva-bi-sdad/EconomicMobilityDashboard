<b>Constructing Composite Indices</b>
<p style="text-align:left;">
Our composite indices quantify community capital areas. The concepts of the indices were informed by stakeholders meetings, workshops, and existing literature on community capital. The construction of each index followed a four-step process. 
<p style="text-align:left;">
1. <u>Measure Selection</u>: The selection of measures or variables was guided by existing literature and research; input from the Cooperative Extension Service community; relevance to the composite; data availability and coverage; and associations between the variables.
<p style="text-align:left;">
2. <u>Exploratory Data Analysis</u>: Data analyses were conducted on each measure to evaluate missing and outlying values, the shape of the distribution, and the relationship between the measures. These analyses were used to inform decisions on missing value imputation, the treatment of outliers, and dimensionality reduction.
<p style="text-align:left;">
3. <u>Normalization</u>: Directional adjustments were made prior to constructing a composite so that high values correspond to assets and low values correspond to liabilities. After directional adjustment, the distribution of each measure was transformed into a quintile frequency distribution. Original values were assigned a number from 1 to 5, for example, values were assigned a value of 1 if they were within the lowest quintile and a value of 5 if they were within the highest quintile. 
<p style="text-align:left;">
4. <u>Aggregation Method</u>: The quintile distributions for each measure were aggregated at the county and city level by summing the transformed values and dividing by the number of measures. An average value of 5 represents the maximum value. Composite indices quantifying capital liabilities are displayed using mustard sequential choropleths and composite indices quantifying capital assets are displayed using green sequential choropleths.

<b>Interpreting Composite Indices</b>
<p style="text-align:left;">
Choropleths on the first panel display the value of the composite index at the county level for the selected state. Choropleths and boxplots on the second panel display the non-normalized values for each measure that is part of the selected index. The filled circles over the box plot indicate the relative rurality of the county or city; the more saturated the shade of orange, the more rural, and the more saturated the shade of olive, the more urban a county or city is.

<b>Index of Relative Rurality</b>
<p style="text-align:left;">
We display variable boxplots by county relative rurality. We assign county rurality using Waldorf and Kim's 2010 Index of Relative Rurality (IRR). The IRR is based on population size, density, remoteness, and built-up area, and ranges from 0 (most urban) to 1 (most rural).
